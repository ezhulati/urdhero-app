# Urdhëro UI Component Library

The UI component library serves as the foundation of the Urdhëro user interface. It provides a collection of reusable, consistent components that can be composed to create complex interfaces while maintaining visual coherence.

## Design Principles

The Urdhëro UI component library follows these core design principles:

1. **Consistency**: All components share common design patterns, spacing, and interaction behaviors.
2. **Accessibility**: Components are designed to be accessible, supporting keyboard navigation, screen readers, and proper contrast.
3. **Responsiveness**: Components adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and device types.
4. **Performance**: Components are optimized for performance, minimizing unnecessary re-renders and bundle size.
5. **Composability**: Components can be easily combined to create more complex UI patterns.

## Component Organization

The UI components are organized into the following categories:

1. **Core Components**: Basic building blocks like Button, Card, Badge, etc.
2. **Layout Components**: Components for structuring the page like grids, containers, etc.
3. **Form Components**: Inputs, selects, checkboxes, etc.
4. **Feedback Components**: Notifications, alerts, progress indicators, etc.
5. **Navigation Components**: Menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, etc.
6. **Data Display Components**: Tables, lists, etc.

## Implementation Details

### Styling

Components use Tailwind CSS for styling. Key patterns include:

- Using consistent spacing based on the Tailwind scale
- Using the Tailwind color palette for consistency
- Using common border radius, shadow, and transition properties

### Animation

Animations are implemented using Framer Motion with these principles:

- Subtle animations that enhance the user experience without being distracting
- Consistent timing and easing functions
- Accessibility considerations like respecting reduced motion preferences

### State Management

Components handle their internal state following these patterns:

- Controlled vs. uncontrolled components
- Proper prop passing
- Event handlers with consistent naming

## Using Components

To use a component in your React application:

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from '../components/ui';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>This is an example of using UI components.</p>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Extending Components

To extend existing components:

1. Create a new component that composes the base component
2. Use the `className` prop to add additional styles
3. Forward additional props as needed

Example:

```tsx
import { Button, ButtonProps } from '../components/ui';

interface PrimaryButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
}

export const PrimaryButton: React.FC<PrimaryButtonProps> = ({ 
  children, 
  icon, 
  ...props 
}) => {
  return (
    <Button 
      variant="primary" 
      className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600"
      {...props}
    >
      {icon && <span className="mr-2">{icon}</span>}
      {children}
    </Button>
  );
};
```

## Testing Components

Components are tested using React Testing Library. Key testing patterns include:

1. Testing the rendered output
2. Testing user interactions
3. Testing accessibility
4. Testing responsive behavior

## Documentation

Each component is documented with:

1. TypeScript interface definitions for props
2. JSDoc comments explaining the component and its props
3. Usage examples
4. Storybook stories showcasing different variations

## Best Practices

When working with UI components:

1. Always prefer using existing components over creating new ones
2. Maintain the design system constraints (colors, spacing, etc.)
3. Document any new components following the established patterns
4. Consider accessibility in all component implementations
5. Keep components focused on a single responsibility
6. Ensure components are thoroughly tested
